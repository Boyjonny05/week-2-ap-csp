# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Jonathan"
age = 15
favorite_color = "Purple"

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print("Name Uppercase:", first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print("Length of phrase:", len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print(first_name())
print(favorite_color())

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number


#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers




# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
